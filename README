rpr - rich presence
====================
rpr is a simple rich presence daemon for discord clients.  rpr searches for
known tasks and, if it finds one, sends some data to provide rich presence.  If
a task is not found, system uptime is sent.

Requirements
------------
rpr requires the discord gamesdk, which can be installed as libdsdk with the
following command (run as root):

    ./libdsdk.sh


Installation
------------
rpr comes with a Makefile and config.mk file for configurable building and
testing.  Edit the latter to match your local setup (rpr is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default, you may need to modify your $PATH).

rpr can be built and installed with the following command (run as root):

    make clean install


Configuration
-------------
rpr can be configured by directly editing rpr.sh file containing the known
tasks.  This keeps it simple and modular.
