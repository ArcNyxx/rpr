rpr - rich presence
====================
rpr is a simple and configurable rich presence daemon for discord clients.
rpr searches for indications of known tasks and sends information about the
first it finds to a running discord client to be displayed globally.

Requirements
------------
rpr requires the discord gamesdk, which can be easily installed as libdsdk
with the provided script.

Installation
------------
rpr comes with a Makefile and config.mk file for configurable building and
testing.  Edit the latter to match your local setup (rpr is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default, you may need to modify your $PATH).

libdsdk can be installed with the following command (run as root):

    ./libdsdk.sh

rpr can be built and installed with the following command (run as root):

    make clean install


Configuration
-------------
rpr can be configured by directly editing status.sh.  This keeps it simple and
modular.
